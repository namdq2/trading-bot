# ARBITRAGE TRADING BOT - COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION

## PART 1: ARBITRAGE TRADING STRATEGY

### 1. Arbitrage Trading Overview

#### 1.1. Definition
Arbitrage trading is a strategy that takes advantage of price differences for the same asset across different markets to generate profit.

#### 1.2. Types of Arbitrage
1. Pure Arbitrage
2. Statistical Arbitrage
3. Triangular Arbitrage

### 2. Pure Arbitrage Strategy Details

#### 2.1. Two-Exchange Buffer Strategy
```
Capital structure per exchange:
- 70% USDT
- 30% Token

Example with 100,000 USDT:
Exchange A:
- 35,000 USDT
- 15,000 worth Token

Exchange B:
- 35,000 USDT
- 15,000 worth Token
```

#### 2.2. Trading Example
```
Scenario:
- Token price at Exchange A: 100 USDT
- Token price at Exchange B: 100.5 USDT
- Spread: 0.5%
- Trading fee: 0.1% per exchange

Execution:
1. Buy 100 tokens at A = 10,000 USDT
2. Sell 100 tokens at B = 10,050 USDT

Calculation:
- Gross profit: 50 USDT
- Fees: 20 USDT (10 USDT per exchange)
- Net profit: 30 USDT (0.3%)
```

### 3. Key Profit Indicators

#### 3.1. Primary Indicators
1. Spread:
```
Formula: 
Spread % = ((Sell Price - Buy Price) / Buy Price) × 100

Example:
- Buy price A: 100 USDT
- Sell price B: 100.5 USDT
- Spread = 0.5%

Minimum threshold:
- Spread > (Total fees + 0.1%)
```

2. Volume and Liquidity:
```
Key Metrics:
- 24h Volume
- Orderbook depth
- Market impact
- Available liquidity

Liquidity Check Example:
Required volume: 100 Tokens
Exchange A orderbook:
- 50 tokens at 100 USDT
- 30 tokens at 100.1 USDT
- 20 tokens at 100.2 USDT
→ Average slippage: 0.1%
```

3. Volatility:
```
Measurements:
- Price standard deviation
- 24h price range
- Candle size

Example:
High Volatility:
- StdDev > 2%
- Candles > 1%
→ Increased risk, higher spread required
```

#### 3.2. Risk Indicators

1. Stop Loss:
```
Settings:
- Per-trade loss limit
- Daily loss percentage
- Maximum drawdown

Example:
- Per trade: -0.2%
- Daily: -1%
- Drawdown: -5%
```

2. Position Size:
```
Calculation:
Size = Min(
    % Account size,
    % Available liquidity,
    Risk limit / Volatility
)

Example with 100,000 USDT:
- Account size limit: 10% = 10,000
- Liquidity available: 15,000
- Volatility: 2%
→ Size = Min(10000, 15000, 5000) = 5000
```
